* Maybe switch to C99 (to allow inline).
* Allow user to define its own Panic() function.
* Be compatible with C++ user tasks.
* Define a file header to add to each file for public distribution.
** Like that :
   #+BEGIN_SRC C
   /*
    * This file is part of the Lazuli project.
    *
    * This file is in the public domain, as well as all files of this project.
    *
    * Authors:
    *      Remi Andruccioli (2017)
    * 
    */
   #+END_SRC
* Insert a raw string in the final binary to keep track of the kernel and version.
  Somthing like "Lazuli 1.42.63 ", with delimiters, or fixed size.
* Get a real Makefile, or build system, or whatever.
* Resources file
** With links and documentation over the Internet.
