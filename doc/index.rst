Welcome to Lazuli's documentation!
==================================

You are in the documentation of the Lazuli project.

This documentation is divided in two parts: User and Kernel.

The User documentation is intended for end users, who wish to develop
real-time systems and applications using the Lazuli kernel.

The Kernel documentation is intended for programmers, who wish to code in the
Lazuli kernel, hacking and improving it. It is highly recommended to readers of
the Kernel documentation to have read the User documentation first.
