Getting Lazuli
==============

To start developing with Lazuli, the first thing to do is to get your own copy
of the Lazuli source code.

Lazuli is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/randruc/Lazuli


Using Git
---------

To get a copy of the Lazuli repository using Git, simply clone the GitHub
repository::

    git clone https://github.com/randruc/Lazuli.git



Without Git
-----------

If you're not using Git, you can download a copy of the repository as a ZIP
file here : https://github.com/randruc/Lazuli/archive/master.zip

You can then unzip it in any directory you wish.
